  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">I’ve tried to find a job since January 2013 in London and found one. It was British company and I started to work there as a tender engineer in March 2013 and worked there for more than 3years.
  I studied naval architecture and marine engineering at Ulsan University, South Korea. I have also gained valuable industry experience in a variety of fields including EPC, EPCI and EPCM projects in the oil, gas and energy industries.
  With international experience working in South Korea, China and England I gained a practical knowledge of the project life cycle and appreciate the flexibility and initiative required for this position.
  I have participated in 94 bids and involved in many different phases of the new construction, demolition and modification projects for offshore and onshore plant, providing commercial and technical support.  </p>
